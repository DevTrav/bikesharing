# bikesharing

## Project Overview
This project analyzes bikeshare data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. Using sample citibike data from Newy York, New York, this analysis might help answer a few key questions:
- Who uses bikeshare programs?
- What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
- What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
- How much are the bikes used and by whom?

## Results

The data shows that a majority of starting points are concentrated in Manhattan. This could be an indicator of a high-foot traffic area with attractions, which could mean a tourist hub.
